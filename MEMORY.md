## 2026-10-25 — Restrict the Tools page to administrators

- The sidebar now shows the Tools link only when auth status identifies the current user as an administrator. Direct `/tools` navigation redirects non-administrators to the task page.
- Added frontend coverage for hiding the link from a regular user.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (48), backend tests pass (17), `pnpm build` and `git diff --check` pass. The first parallel `pnpm test` invocation exited in the backend with no test output; the standalone backend run passed.

## 2026-10-25 — Add user management commands to Taskfile

- Added `dev:docker:users:list`, `create`, `update`, and `delete` Taskfile commands. They invoke the backend CLI with the configured `DATABASE_URL`; create/update options are passed through Task variables.
- Updated README account-management examples to use the `dev:docker` task prefix.
- Verification: `task --list-all`, dry-runs of all four tasks, and `git diff --check` pass.

## 2026-10-25 — Add Docker PostgreSQL dump and restore tasks

- Added `task db:dump` to save a timestamped custom-format PostgreSQL archive from the dev Compose database; `DB_DUMP_FILE` can override the output path.
- Added `task db:restore` to restore a specified archive (or the default dump path) with `pg_restore`; it replaces existing database objects.
- Verification: Taskfile parsing/listing checked; application tests not run because this is Taskfile-only infrastructure work.

## 2026-10-25 — Add multi-user accounts and isolated task data

- Added a `users` table and migration that transfers the old settings-based account, preferences, sessions, and all existing tasks/projects/sections to that user; the obsolete singleton settings table is removed after migration.
- Each API request resolves its session to a user and scopes task, project, and section repository operations to that user. User preferences and Inbox descriptions are also per-user.
- Added administrator-only user creation, updates, password resets, role changes, and deletion in Settings and the `users` backend CLI. Prevents removing/demoting the last administrator. For an installation with no old password, set the migrated admin password with the CLI before managing users.
- Added backend isolation/auth/role tests, Settings UI tests, and updated E2E expectations for date dialog labels. Playwright defaults to one worker because its tests share a database and honors `DATABASE_URL` in the Docker test environment.
- Verification: `pnpm test` passes (76 unit/integration tests), `pnpm build` passes, full E2E passes (23 tests), and `git diff --check` passes. Restored the dev Docker stack after the Docker test task removed its containers/volumes during cleanup.

## 2026-09-24 — Prompt 011 (projects edit/delete, drag reorder, indent/outdent)

Baseline before this session:
- Drag & drop is native HTML5 (no @dnd-kit, no Tailwind — plain CSS), drop onto a task makes it a subtask; no sibling reordering (`beforeId`/`afterId` always null).
- Projects: model + GET/POST API + sidebar create UI only; no edit/delete.
- Sections: fully working for Inbox only (create/edit/delete); schema supports projectId but UI never uses it.
- Task editing: inline form with title + "Move to" placement select.
- No keyboard shortcuts; no MEMORY.md.
- E2E drag helpers synthesize DragEvents in page (`e2e/tasks.spec.ts`); jsdom tests synthesize them via fireEvent.

Decisions for this session:
- Drop zones on a task row use thirds: top 35% = insert before, middle = make subtask, bottom 35% = insert after; a red insertion line indicates before/after (Todoist-style).
- Indent/outdent is keyboard-driven like Todoist: Ctrl/Cmd+ArrowRight makes the task a subtask of the sibling above; Ctrl/Cmd+ArrowLeft outdents it below its parent. Business logic lives in `/packages/domain` as pure functions (`computeDropPlacement`, `computeIndentPlacement`, `computeOutdentPlacement`).
- Deleting a project cascades: its sections and all their tasks (with descendants) are deleted.
- `moveTask` API contract now always sends `beforeId`/`afterId`.

Completed in this session:
- Finished prompt 011 end-to-end: project edit/delete UI, task edit UI polish, Todoist-like drag zones, sibling reorder, keyboard indent/outdent, and moved "Export all ZIP" into the left sidebar.
- Wired frontend API to the backend project/task contracts (`updateProject`, `deleteProject`, `updateTask`, `beforeId`/`afterId` moves).
- Added/updated domain, backend, frontend unit tests and Playwright E2E coverage for project CRUD, reorder, indent/outdent, exports, and existing task/section flows.
- Set Playwright `outputDir` to `/tmp/todoist-clone-playwright-results` by default because the repo-local `test-results` directory is owned by `nobody`; `PLAYWRIGHT_OUTPUT_DIR` can override it.
- Current verification: `pnpm test` passes and `pnpm test:e2e` passes.

## 2026-09-24 — Prompt 012 (Bootstrap UI, tools sidebar, drag polish)

What changed:
- Treated `aiignore/prompts/12.md` as prompt 012 because `aiignore/prompts/012.md` is absent.
- Added Bootstrap styling support and moved the app CSS into `apps/frontend/src/App.module.css`; Bootstrap CSS is vendored under `apps/frontend/src/vendor/` so Vite/Playwright can resolve it consistently in this workspace.
- Updated the main UI shell with a Bootstrap-friendly card layout, a shared left sidebar style, a `/tools` link when tools are enabled, and the same sidebar layout on `/tools`.
- Improved drag feedback: project/section/inbox drop targets highlight while hovering, task drag insertion lines include a red marker circle, task rows update insertion state on dragover, and dragging a nested task left can outdent it.
- Avoided Bootstrap `.modal` naming collisions by renaming the markdown preview classes.

Verification:
- `pnpm test` passes.
- `pnpm test:e2e` passes when run with elevated local binding permissions; plain sandboxed runs can fail because Playwright's dev servers need to listen on `127.0.0.1:3000` and `127.0.0.1:5173`.

## 2026-09-24 — Prompt quality review

- Reviewed prompts in `aiignore/prompts/` for clarity, sequencing, testability, and alignment with `AGENTS.md`.
- No product/code behavior was changed.
- Current verification: tests not run because this was an analysis-only review.

## 2026-09-24 — Functional style and library review

- Reviewed current domain, frontend, backend, and dependency setup for functional-programming fit and possible library additions.
- Conclusion: current FP style is mostly pragmatic TypeScript; biggest simplification opportunities are module boundaries and feature libraries rather than adding a heavy FP library.
- No product/code behavior was changed.
- Current verification: tests not run because this was an analysis-only review.

## 2026-09-24 — Immutable data structures library discussion

- Reviewed lightweight options for immutable/persistent data handling in TypeScript.
- Conclusion: prefer no full persistent-collection library for now; consider `immer` only for deeply nested UI/cache updates, or `remeda` for collection helper ergonomics.
- No product/code behavior was changed.
- Current verification: tests not run because this was an analysis-only discussion.

## 2026-09-24 — Freeze helper discussion

- Reviewed `freezeTask`, `freezeProject`, and `freezeSection` helpers in backend repositories.
- Conclusion: these wrappers are technically valid but not worth the ceremony; inline `Object.freeze({...})`, typed factory helpers with meaningful names, or relying on TypeScript `Readonly` at boundaries would be clearer.
- No product/code behavior was changed.
- Current verification: tests not run because this was an analysis-only discussion.

## 2026-09-24 — Prompt 013 (libraries, freeze cleanup, dev-docker reload)

What changed:
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with the immutability guidance from prompt 013: prefer TypeScript `Readonly` types, use runtime `Object.freeze()` only at useful boundaries, and avoid ceremonial freeze wrappers.
- Removed `freezeTask`/`freezeProject`/`freezeSection` wrappers from backend repositories and inlined freezing at creation/mapping boundaries.
- Added requested frontend libraries: `@dnd-kit/*`, `jszip`, `clsx`, `lucide-react`, and `@floating-ui/react`.
- Used those libraries in the app: DnD context/sensors wrap the task app, ZIP export uses `jszip`, class composition uses `clsx`, buttons use lucide icons, and the markdown preview modal uses Floating UI overlay/focus management.
- Kept Bootstrap loading reliable through the vendored CSS import added in prompt 012.
- Added Docker dev polling env vars (`CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING`, `WATCHPACK_POLLING`, `VITE_USE_POLLING`) so `task dev:docker` sees bind-mounted source changes more reliably without manual restarts.

Verification:
- `pnpm test` passes.
- `pnpm --filter @todoist-clone/frontend build` passes.
- `pnpm test:e2e` passes against the refreshed dev-docker stack. The first E2E attempt reused an old container dev server with stale dependencies; after `docker compose --env-file .env.example -f docker-compose.dev.yml down` and `up -d --wait`, the suite passed.

## 2026-09-25 — React/CSS/Bootstrap review prompt

- Added `aiignore/prompts/tasks/review-react-css-bootstrap.md` with a focused review prompt for React component size, moderate modularity, CSS organization, and Bootstrap-first styling.
- No product code was changed.
- Current verification: tests not run because this was a documentation/prompt-only change.

## 2026-09-25 — Code quality, modularity, functionality, and AGENTS.md analysis

- Added `aiignore/prompts/tasks/code-quality-analysis.md` with a review of code quality, modularity, functionality quality, test coverage, and `AGENTS.md`.
- Rated the project at 74% overall and identified the main risks: oversized `App.tsx`, fragile drag-and-drop, weak backend move validation, duplicated repository logic, and stale `AGENTS.md` stack notes.
- No product code was changed.
- Current verification: tests not run because this was an analysis/documentation-only change.

## 2026-10-22 — Fix dev Docker page styling

- Found that `App.module.css` contained global stylesheet rules but was imported as a CSS Module without using its generated class exports; Vite omitted the app rules from the generated stylesheet.
- Renamed it to `App.css` and imported it as ordinary global CSS from `App.tsx`.
- Verification: frontend production build passes and output CSS includes `.shell`, `.app-layout`, and `.task-row`. Existing Docker dev stack is running and should hot reload the fix; no unit/E2E tests run for this CSS import correction.

## 2026-10-22 — Add full Markdown export and preview

- Added sidebar actions below “Export all ZIP”: “Export all markdown” downloads a combined `todoist-clone.md`, and “Preview all markdown” opens the shared preview dialog with every Inbox, section, and project document.
- Added a frontend test for the all-tasks preview flow.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (22 tests) and frontend production build passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Focus task title on edit

- Added autofocus to the task edit Title input so it receives focus when the user opens Edit.
- Extended the task edit UI test to assert focus.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (22 tests) and frontend production build passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Focus subtask title on add

- Added autofocus to the new subtask input when the user opens the Add subtask form.
- Extended the subtask creation UI test to assert focus.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (22 tests) and frontend production build passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Close Markdown preview with Escape

- Added Escape key handling to the Markdown preview dialog so it closes from anywhere inside the focused dialog.
- Extended the preview UI test to assert the dialog closes on Escape.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (22 tests) and frontend production build passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Correct the Todoist Clone spelling

- Corrected the project name across user-facing app labels, page title, README, package/workspace names, imports, Docker commands, Playwright settings, export filenames, and existing memory/prompts.
- Updated pnpm workspace links and lockfile; `pnpm test` passes (40 unit tests) and `pnpm build` passes.
- E2E attempt was blocked because the already running Docker dev backend occupies port 3000; its `/tasks` health URL reset the connection, and Playwright could not start a second backend on that port. No Docker services were stopped.

## 2026-10-22 — Restyle the app to match the Todoist reference

- Reworked the app shell and CSS toward the provided Todoist screenshot: narrow warm sidebar, active navigation treatment, centered white task column, compact section/task rows, circular completion controls, and quieter hover actions.
- Retained the existing project, export, editing, and task behavior.
- Verification: all unit tests pass (40 tests) and `pnpm build` passes. No E2E rerun; the existing Docker dev process had occupied port 3000 in the previous E2E attempt.

## 2026-10-22 — Refine Tools UI, type size, workspace width, and priorities

- Applied the shared Todoist-inspired shell to Tools and restyled its controls, query editor, and result pane.
- Set the app base text to Bootstrap's 16px default and raised small UI labels/buttons to that scale.
- Widened the centered workspace to 820px on desktop, with fluid width on mobile.
- Removed task priority labels from the task list UI while keeping priority data and Markdown export behavior intact; added a UI assertion.
- Verification: all unit tests pass (40 tests) and `pnpm build` passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Polish Markdown preview and Tools buttons

- Restyled all sidebar export actions as Todoist-like navigation rows and added matching file/preview icons.
- Replaced green Tools buttons with neutral Todoist-style controls, red hover states for destructive actions, and a red primary Run query button.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (22 tests) and frontend production build passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Align Markdown export buttons with ZIP export

- Prevented the longer Markdown export labels from wrapping, and set all sidebar export rows to the same compact height and text size as the ZIP action.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (22 tests) and frontend production build passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Make Markdown export icons visible

- Switched the Markdown download symbol to a clearer download icon and fixed sidebar export SVG dimensions, flex shrinking, and Todoist-red contrast.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (22 tests) and frontend production build passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Widen navigation sidebar and compact project actions

- Doubled the desktop Navigation sidebar width from 190px to 380px.
- Removed visible Edit/Delete labels from project controls while retaining their aria-labels and icons; set fixed icon button sizing.
- Made project names truncate with an ellipsis when the available column is too narrow.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (22 tests) and frontend production build passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Add deletion preferences and cookie sessions

- Added persistent application settings for delete confirmations (enabled by default) and anonymous/password access, plus a settings page to edit them.
- Added scrypt password hashing, database-backed 30-day sessions, HttpOnly SameSite cookies, login/logout, and access middleware for protected API routes.
- Added auth/settings Vite proxies while preserving SPA navigation to `/settings`; protected auth tables from the development tools' clear/drop helpers.
- Added backend/frontend coverage and a browser check for the default settings.
- Verification: `pnpm test` (46 tests) and `pnpm build` pass. E2E: settings, task creation, and tools pass; the pre-existing project edit workflow test still fails because its Edit project button is absent from the rendered page after project creation.
- Current state: database migration applied locally; access remains anonymous until changed in Settings.

## 2026-10-22 — Add full Markdown copy, task details, table browsing, project menus, and archives

- Added a Copy all markdown action and a Tools table inspector with 10, 100, or all rows, newest-first where a timestamp/ID column is available.
- Extended tasks with persisted description, due date, labels, and comments; task titles open a detail dialog with editing, comment entry, and subtask add/delete. Existing inline edit controls remain.
- Added project duplicate/archive operations, moved project edit/delete into a menu, and added an Archived projects page with restore/delete.
- Added an idempotent schema migration and isolated E2E servers/database on ports 3100/5174 so E2E no longer uses the user's password-protected app database.
- Applied migration 0002 to the local app database without changing its access mode.
- Verification: `pnpm test` passes (48 unit tests), `pnpm build` passes, and `pnpm test:e2e` passes (6 browser tests).

## 2026-10-22 — Improve archive browsing, comments, add forms, and Tools UI

- Added a task tree viewer to each archived project entry, including descriptions, dates, labels, and nested subtasks.
- Added comment editing and deletion controls to task details; deletion follows the configured confirmation preference.
- Wrapped project and section creation forms in Bootstrap cards with padding and a light background for visible grouping.
- Reorganized Tools into card sections for table browsing, maintenance actions, SQL editing, and results; improved button hierarchy, status, and responsive layout.
- Verification: unit tests (48), build, and all 6 E2E tests pass. E2E covers archived task viewing/restoration and comment edit/delete.

## 2026-10-22 — Visually group task creation

- Wrapped the task creation form in a Bootstrap light card with border and padding, matching the project and section creation blocks.
- Applied to Inbox and project views through the shared task form.

## 2026-10-22 — Fix duplicate project menu and refresh cloned tasks

- Converted project menus to controlled open state and close them before dispatching menu actions.
- After a project is duplicated, invalidate/refetch projects, sections, and tasks so the copied tree appears immediately without a page reload.
- Extended Playwright coverage to create a project with a task and nested subtask, duplicate it, assert the menu closes, open the copy, and verify both tasks are immediately visible.
- Verification: all unit tests, build, and all 6 Playwright scenarios pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Add Dates and Labels views and polish Tools/task details

- Added `/dates` and `/labels` task views that filter the full nested task tree while retaining the shared task controls and task detail dialog.
- Displayed labels as clickable chips on task rows; clicking one opens the cross-project label filter. Added a Bootstrap chip based label editor with existing-label suggestions in task details.
- Expanded the Tools sidebar with the same navigation links, active projects, project creation, and Markdown/ZIP actions as the home sidebar; improved Tools spacing and task detail dialog buttons.
- Added frontend and Playwright coverage for date/label views and label navigation. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and `pnpm test:e2e` pass (6 browser tests).

## 2026-10-22 — Add Todoist-style task search

- Added Search to the task and Tools sidebars, with a centered command palette that opens via click or Ctrl+K and closes with Escape.
- Search matches task titles, descriptions, and labels; task results open task details and label results open the cross-project Labels filter. Added navigation shortcuts when the query is empty.
- Added frontend and browser coverage for description search, label search results, and keyboard opening.

## 2026-10-22 — Fix Dates/Labels navigation, search layering, and list order

- Selecting Inbox or a project from Dates/Labels now switches back to the task view and updates the URL; task rows display any set due date.
- Portaled the search palette to `document.body` with a high stacking order so it overlays task rows/sidebar contexts.
- Project/section rename and archive cache updates now replace items in place, preserving lexical list order instead of moving updated entries to the end.
- Added Playwright coverage for cross-view navigation, search overlay layering, and project/section order before and after reload. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and all 7 E2E tests pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Make task details autosave and show task location

- Removed the task-wide Save action. Title and description save on blur, date saves on change, and label add/remove saves immediately; the dialog shows save status.
- Added Inbox/project breadcrumbs, a parent task link for subtasks, and a Project or Inbox selector that moves the task immediately.
- Restyled the dialog fields and location trail to fit the app's Todoist-like UI. Added unit and Playwright coverage for autosave, parent/project navigation, and task relocation.
- Verification: `pnpm test` (30 frontend tests plus domain/backend suites), `pnpm build`, and all 7 Playwright tests pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Make task details edit on demand

- Reworked Task details into a wide two-column layout inspired by Todoist, with task content on the left and project/date/labels metadata on the right.
- Title and description now render as text until clicked; inline editors have Save/Cancel, Enter saves, and Escape cancels. Saves update the task query cache immediately.
- Dates render as text with Add date/Remove date actions; clicking the displayed date opens a date editor dialog. Label entry adds the label on Enter.
- Updated component and Playwright coverage for the new interactions. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and all 7 Playwright E2E tests pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Fix navigation shortcuts and add date/calendar workflow

- Task details now reliably closes with Escape; task, project, and section inline editors cancel with Escape and save on Enter.
- Fixed route state when navigating from Dates/Labels back to Inbox or a project. Added calendar/list modes to Dates, navigation icons, and removed Markdown actions from Dates/Labels.
- Search now includes project and section matches. Settings has the full navigation sidebar.
- Added a top-of-sidebar Add task dialog with project, optional date/description/labels, plus Q and Russian-layout Й shortcuts.
- Added Playwright coverage for these workflows, including Escape/Enter behavior, project/section search, Dates navigation, calendar mode, settings navigation, and quick-add shortcuts. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and full 8-test Playwright suite passed.

## 2026-10-22 — Refine task details header and date/project controls

- Changed brand marks to Todoist red; removed the separate task-location breadcrumb row and moved project/section/parent/task path into the modal header.
- Project location is now always a dropdown and saves immediately on selection. Date controls open the date picker directly, and native `showPicker()` is requested when the editor opens.
- Enter adds a subtask from its title field. Dates/Labels no longer mark Inbox active, and project/section edit inputs autofocus.
- Added/updated Playwright assertions for active navigation, modal header, project dropdown, subtask Enter, and project/section focus. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and all 8 Playwright E2E tests pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Project/section create controls, date picker, and project sorting

- Replaced always-visible project/section forms with red add buttons that reveal focused Title editors; Escape cancels and Enter submits. Creating a project now selects it. Project navigation now keeps the URL in sync.
- Added persisted project drag sorting using lexical ordering and a `PATCH /projects/:id/order` route. Dates use a Todoist-style picker with quick choices and a month grid; Escape closes the picker while remaining in Task details.
- Task detail title/description Escape now exits only the active editor. Dates and Labels preserve all descendants under a matching task. Added frontend/backend unit tests and Playwright coverage for editor keys, create controls, and project sorting across reloads.
- Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and `NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1,localhost E2E_BACKEND_PORT=3105 E2E_FRONTEND_PORT=5179 pnpm test:e2e` all pass (8 E2E tests).

## 2026-10-22 — Restore the native task date picker

- Replaced the custom quick-choice calendar with the previous native `input[type=date]` dialog and `showPicker()` behavior for adding and changing task dates. Kept Save/Cancel and the Escape handling around Task details.
- Updated the date picker UI and Playwright assertions. `pnpm test` and `pnpm build` pass; focused task-details Playwright test passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Task date shortcuts and button styling

- Task detail dates now include the year. Added Today, Tomorrow, This weekend, and Next week actions to the native date dialog; choosing one saves and closes the dialog.
- Restyled the Subtasks area as a Bootstrap card and made Save/Add actions and the sidebar Add task button Todoist red.
- Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and the focused task-details Playwright test pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Auto-growing text fields and project sections

- Replaced task and subtask title editors plus task description/comment editors with controlled, auto-growing textareas. Enter still submits single-line title fields; Shift+Enter inserts a newline.
- Added project-scoped section creation, editing, deletion, task drop zones, and placement options; Markdown preview now includes project sections.
- Project drag source and target visuals now match task drag/drop opacity and highlight styles.
- Added Playwright checks for textarea growth and project section workflows. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and all 8 Playwright tests pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Bulk task deletion, section Markdown, and scoped task creation

- Added confirmation protected “Delete all tasks” to Inbox and project views; deletes each top-level task with its descendants across the whole scope, including sections.
- Rebuilt Markdown documents around one `#` title and `##` headings for section/scope content. ZIP notes now include their sections, and the single-file export is one unified document.
- Added Add task controls to Inbox, project roots, and each section. The dialog defaults to that scope and its location dropdown now includes Inbox, projects, and sections.
- Added domain and Playwright coverage for heading levels, scoped task placement, and bulk deletion. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and all 9 Playwright tests pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Task actions and embedded date picker

- Task row action buttons now remain visible without hover.
- Added a shared embedded calendar panel to the Change date and Add task dialogs. Quick dates update the selected value without closing the dialog; Save date / Set date applies it. Escape cancels the date picker while keeping the parent task dialog open.
- Added Playwright coverage for visible task actions, embedded date selection, quick-date persistence, and Add task date selection. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and all 9 Playwright tests pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Remove priorities and add section/calendar drag and drop

- Removed task priority from shared domain types, API validation and payloads, repositories, database schema, Tools seeding, and Markdown output. Added a migration to drop the persisted column and included it in Tools migrations.
- Added persisted lexical reordering for sections, matching project ordering. Project and section drag targets now show a red insertion line and circle.
- Tasks in Dates calendar can now be dragged onto another day; the task date is saved and the calendar refreshes.
- Added backend order tests and Playwright coverage for section reordering and moving a dated task to another calendar day. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and all 9 E2E tests pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Scope descriptions, date highlights, and menu dismissal

- Added editable and deletable descriptions for Inbox and projects, including backend persistence and a database migration. Add section controls now render last in Inbox and project boards.
- Date picker marks today and its selected date with distinct red styling. Project menus close on Escape and outside clicks.
- Dragging projects clears all active drop and dragging states so no project remains highlighted after drop.
- Added unit, backend, and Playwright coverage for descriptions, menu dismissal, date highlights, and project drag cleanup. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and all 10 Playwright tests pass.
- Follow-up: corrected CSS specificity so the Task details dialog's shared button rules no longer hide date state colors. Today now has a pale red fill and border; the selected date has a solid red fill and visible ring. Playwright asserts the computed colors. Full unit, build, and 10-test E2E suites pass.
- Follow-up: increased today's color contrast after user feedback and verified the actual Task details date dialog; the previous computed color was gray because dialog styles overrode the earlier date rules. Full unit, build, and 10-test E2E suites pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Consolidated Markdown and JSON exports

- Moved bulk Markdown actions from the sidebars to `/export` and removed ZIP export. Added Export navigation to the task app, Tools, Settings, and archived-project navigation.
- Added JSON download, clipboard copy, and preview. The JSON document includes Inbox and project descriptions, all projects (including archived), sections, flat tasks and the nested task tree, dates, labels, task descriptions, timestamps, and comments.
- Added unit and Playwright checks for JSON content, downloads, clipboard copy, preview, and removing bulk export buttons from Tools/Settings navigation. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and all 10 Playwright tests pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Scoped Markdown and JSON export dialog

- Replaced Inbox/project header Markdown buttons with one Export action and a dialog for Markdown/JSON previews and clipboard copies. Scope JSON includes the selected Inbox or project, descriptions, sections, full task data/tree, dates, labels, and comments.
- Updated frontend and Playwright checks for scoped export actions and content. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and all 10 Playwright tests pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Refine scoped Export dialog

- Restyled the Inbox/project Export action as a spaced primary button and rebuilt its dialog to match `/export` Markdown/JSON cards.
- Preview dialogs now layer over the options dialog; closing a preview returns to the options. Added unit and Playwright assertions. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and all 10 Playwright tests pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Task details location picker includes sections

- Extended the Task details location dropdown to list Inbox, projects, and project sections, labeled as `Project / Section`. Selecting an option moves the task to the matching project and section.
- Updated frontend and Playwright checks for moving a task into a project section. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and all 10 Playwright tests pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Sort Task details location choices

- Sorted the Inbox, project, and project-section options in the Task details dropdown by their displayed names, case-insensitively. Added unit and Playwright assertions for alphabetical ordering.
- Verification: `pnpm test` and `pnpm build` pass; the Task details Playwright flow passes. The full E2E suite ran 9/10; the unrelated bulk JSON clipboard assertion timed out against the accumulated E2E database contents.

## 2026-10-22 — Independent descriptions for duplicated projects

- Project duplication now opens the newly created project, preventing edits from accidentally targeting the source project. Added UI and backend tests that edit the copy's description and assert the source remains unchanged.
- Rechecked clone integrity: sections and tasks receive new IDs, task section and parent references are remapped, and copied tasks remain visible in the new project. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and the focused project-duplication Playwright test pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Add nested projects and drag between hierarchy levels

- Added nullable project `parentId`, the `0005_project_hierarchy` migration, subproject creation, and a project-parent API with cycle and missing-parent checks.
- Sidebar projects render as an indented tree. A project's menu can add a subproject; dropping onto a row nests the dragged project, while dropping above/below moves it to the target's parent level. Deleting a project promotes its immediate children to its parent level.
- Added backend hierarchy coverage and Playwright coverage for creating, nesting, and outdenting projects.
- Verification: `pnpm test` (62 unit tests) and `pnpm build` pass; focused Playwright subproject workflow passes. Full Playwright run: 10/11 pass; the existing broad project/sections/tasks scenario exceeded its 30-second limit under the parallel full run, while the new hierarchy scenario passed.

## 2026-10-22 — Nested projects and drag placement

- Added persisted `parentId` hierarchy, subproject creation in project menus, nested sidebar indentation, and drag targets for moving projects inside another project or back to a shallower level. Parent cycles are rejected; project ordering is scoped to siblings.
- Added schema migration plus backend, frontend, and Playwright coverage for creation, nesting, unnesting, cycle rejection, and sibling order. Verification: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and the subproject drag Playwright test pass.

## 2026-10-22 — Stabilize project drag-and-drop

- Native HTML5 drag events expose the project MIME type during `dragover`, but browsers protect `getData()` until `drop`; project hover now uses the active drag state when the payload is unavailable. This fixes real mouse drags that previously never reached the drop handler.
- Aligned sidebar tree sorting with server lexical ordering, prevented drops that would create a project cycle, preserved drop feedback while the pointer crosses row children, and sequenced move/reorder mutations with refresh on errors.
- Added Playwright checks for real mouse dragging, before/after sibling reordering with reload persistence, nesting/outdenting, stable hover feedback, and cycle prevention. The four focused drag scenarios pass. `pnpm test` (62 tests) and `pnpm build` pass. Full E2E on an isolated database passed 14/14 serially. The earlier run on the accumulated E2E DB timed out in three unrelated flows because of the large shared test dataset.

## 2026-10-22 — Save task description and comments with Ctrl+Enter

- Task description and new comment fields now save on Ctrl+Enter; regular Enter continues inserting a newline.
- Added a Russian hint below both fields explaining the shortcut.
- Verification: not run.

## 2026-10-22 — Use English shortcut hints

- Changed the task description and add-comment Ctrl+Enter hints to English.
- Ensured the description hint appears directly below its text field.
- Verification: not run.

## 2026-10-22 — Improve mobile usability

- Replaced the cramped mobile sidebar behavior with a horizontally scrollable sticky navigation strip that keeps Inbox, views, and projects reachable.
- Made the task workspace full width on phones, enlarged task completion/action touch targets, and improved narrow-screen wrapping.
- Made task details use the full mobile viewport with safe-area padding, larger controls, and a compact breadcrumb header.
- Verification: not run.

## 2026-10-22 — Add mobile hamburger navigation

- Added a hamburger control for small screens that opens a full-height left navigation drawer with a backdrop and close button.
- Restored project navigation and project creation controls inside the mobile drawer; desktop navigation remains in its existing layout.
- Verification: not run.

## 2026-10-22 — Close mobile navigation after scope selection

- The mobile sidebar now closes after selecting Inbox or a project.
- Verification: not run.

## 2026-10-22 — Add hamburger navigation to secondary pages

- Added the mobile sidebar toggle, backdrop, and close control to Tools, Settings, and Archived projects pages.
- Verification: not run.

## 2026-10-22 — Use React Router for client-side navigation

- Added `react-router-dom` and wrapped the application in `BrowserRouter`.
- Converted navigation links between Tasks, Tools, Settings, Archived projects, Dates, Labels, and Export to router links, and routed project selection through `useNavigate`.
- Route rendering now follows React Router location updates; back/forward navigation remains supported without full document reloads.
- Verification: frontend production build passes. Tests not run.

## 2026-10-22 — Preserve sidebar scroll across route changes

- Shared the latest sidebar scroll position across Tasks, Tools, Settings, and Archived projects navigation mounts.
- Restores the stored position when each route's sidebar mounts, avoiding the jump to the top after navigation.
- Verification: frontend production build passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Normalize project labels and archived navigation

- Removed the inconsistent `#` prefix from project names in Tools and Settings sidebars.
- Expanded the Archived projects sidebar to include search, Add task, all navigation destinations, active projects, and Add project, matching the other app areas.
- Verification: frontend production build passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Prevent task action labels overlapping on phones

- Hid the visible text labels for Edit, Subtask, and Delete on mobile while retaining their accessible names and icons.
- Reserved fixed touch targets for action icons and kept the task title in a flexible, wrapping column.
- Verification: frontend production build passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Keep task dates out of mobile action columns

- Grouped each task title and its due-date/label metadata as one mobile grid item while preserving the desktop grid layout.
- Dates and labels now flow beneath the title, leaving action icons in their fixed columns and preventing Delete from wrapping to another row.
- Verification: frontend production build passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Add touch drag handles for mobile tasks and projects

- Added mobile-only drag handles for task rows and sidebar projects, with touch-based drop placement/reordering and project nesting.
- Kept existing desktop HTML drag-and-drop behavior; no additional library was needed.
- Verification: frontend production build passes; `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Show mobile drag destinations

- Updated touch drag handlers to track the element under the finger and set the same task/project drop state used by desktop drag feedback.
- Mobile task drops now show before/after/inside indicators while moving; project drops show the insertion line or nesting highlight.
- Verification: frontend production build passes; `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Keep mobile project drag handles visible

- Overrode the desktop hover-only project button visibility rule so project drag handles stay visible in the mobile sidebar.
- Verification: frontend production build passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Make mobile project nesting drops reliable

- Mobile project drags now retain the last valid destination and nesting position during touch movement, then use that recorded target on release.
- Expanded the center drop zone so nesting a project is easier on the compact mobile project rows.
- Verification: frontend production build passes; `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Fix and test mobile project nesting

- Mobile project drags now retain and use the hovered project destination through touch release, including when the release target cannot be resolved.
- Added a frontend integration test that simulates dragging one project into another, checks the nesting highlight, and asserts `moveProject` receives the target parent ID.
- Updated an outdated Description test to save with Ctrl+Enter.
- Verification: full `pnpm test` passes (63 tests), frontend production build passes, and `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-10-22 — Fix touch pointer start for mobile project nesting

- Removed the `button === 0` gate from mobile pointer drag starts so touch events without a `button` value are not discarded.
- The frontend integration test now omits `button` and checks the drag starts, highlights the destination, and calls `moveProject` with the target parent.
- Added a Playwright Chromium mobile viewport test using CDP touch input; it confirms the destination highlight and verifies the server stores the target as `parentId`.
- Verification: `pnpm test` passes (63 tests), `pnpm build` passes, and the focused touch E2E passes. A full serial E2E run passed 13/15; two unrelated existing scenarios failed (section reorder and task drag helper).

## 2026-10-22 — Show nested project indentation in the mobile sidebar

- Removed two narrow-screen CSS rules that reset project row indentation with `!important`, so child projects visibly indent in the mobile drawer.
- Extended the mobile touch E2E to assert the nested project renders with an 18px inline start offset after the API confirms its parent.
- Verification: `pnpm test` (63 tests), `pnpm build`, `git diff --check`, and the focused mobile touch E2E all pass.

## 2026-10-23 — Unify sidebar navigation across app pages

- Replaced page-specific sidebars on Tools, Settings, and Archived Projects with the shared `AppSidebar`, which includes the same project tree, drag handles, and project actions as the task workspace.
- Shared sidebar closes immediately on navigation clicks and whenever the router location changes, including query-only project/inbox changes.
- Added frontend coverage for repeat mobile route selection and a Playwright mobile flow that checks drawer closure and consistent project drag handles across pages.
- Verification: `pnpm test` (64 tests) and `pnpm build` pass. The Playwright scenario was added but could not complete in this environment because the local browser run stalled after starting; the default E2E web-server startup also collided with port 3100 in use.

## 2026-10-23 — Stabilize project drag and shared mobile navigation

- Made project creation resilient to an in-flight project query so newly created projects appear immediately without a page reload.
- Stabilized mobile project nesting by measuring coordinates after touch emulation starts, scrolling the handle into view, and exercising a realistic sequence of touch moves.
- Expanded project drag coverage for before, after, nested, outdented, invalid descendant, mouse, touch, persistence, and highlight cleanup behavior.
- Improved section drag target tracking and replaced the flaky section reorder E2E gesture with a complete browser drag event sequence.
- Kept the same full sidebar on task, tools, settings, and archived pages; mobile navigation now closes synchronously after every route selection.
- Updated task drag helpers to target the actual task row, avoiding ambiguous nested content elements.
- Verification: `pnpm test` passes (64 tests), `pnpm build` passes, focused touch drag passes 5 consecutive runs, full Playwright passes (16 tests), and `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-10-23 — Adapt Task details for small mobile screens

- Made the Task details dialog a true full-screen mobile view with a compact safe-area-aware header, one vertical scroll container, and no horizontal overflow.
- Reordered mobile content so project, date, and label metadata appears directly below the task title and description, before subtasks and comments.
- Added mobile spacing, wrapping, touch-sized controls, full-width comment/subtask actions, and a bottom-sheet presentation for the date picker.
- Raised the task dialog above mobile navigation controls and added extra handling for screens narrower than 380px.
- Added a Playwright test at a 360×640 viewport covering dialog bounds, wrapping, content order, overflow, metadata access, and comment controls.
- Verification: `pnpm test` passes (64 tests), `pnpm build` passes, full Playwright passes (17 tests), and `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-10-23 — Adapt Add date for mobile screens

- Made the Add/Change date overlay viewport-fixed on phones so it is independent of the parent Task details or Add task dialog dimensions.
- Presented the picker as a safe-area-aware bottom sheet with a drag affordance, contained scrolling, and no horizontal overflow.
- Changed quick date choices to a touch-sized 2×2 grid and made the date input, month controls, calendar cells, and action buttons fit narrow screens.
- Applied the same quick-date styling to Add task and Task details date pickers.
- Added Playwright coverage at 320×568 for viewport bounds, overflow, quick-date layout, today highlighting, selection behavior, and returning to the Add task dialog.
- Verification: `pnpm test` passes (64 tests), `pnpm build` passes, full Playwright passes (18 tests), and `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-10-23 — Show task descriptions and comment counts in lists

- Task rows now show a non-empty description directly below the title in Inbox, projects, sections, Dates, and Labels views.
- Long descriptions stay on one line and use a visual ellipsis while retaining the full text in the element title.
- Tasks with comments show a comment icon and accessible comment count alongside dates and labels.
- Added unit and Playwright coverage for description rendering, real overflow truncation, comment creation, and count updates.

## 2026-10-23 — Replace label inputs with a shared label picker

- Added one reusable label picker for Add task and Task details with removable chips, Enter-to-add, Backspace removal, Escape cancellation, comma-separated paste support, and filtered suggestions from existing labels.
- Label changes in Task details save immediately, with optimistic local state preventing rapid consecutive additions from overwriting one another.
- Added responsive Todoist-style picker visuals, keyboard-accessible suggestions, focus treatment, and compact chip controls.
- Added unit and Playwright coverage for custom labels, suggestions, removal, keyboard behavior, and Add task integration.
- Verification: `pnpm test` passes (66 tests), `pnpm build` passes, full Playwright passes (20 tests), and `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-10-23 — Improve the Dates month calendar

- Rebuilt the Dates calendar as a stable six-week month grid with Monday-first weekday headings, adjacent-month days, weekend styling, task counts, project or Inbox context, and a prominent current-day marker.
- Added polished month navigation, a Today action, a direct month selector, and a monthly task summary.
- Made the calendar readable on narrow screens through a responsive toolbar and contained horizontal scrolling instead of compressing seven columns.
- Preserved task details opening and made task drag-and-drop between dates more reliable with a drag-state fallback when browser `DataTransfer` is incomplete.
- Added frontend coverage for the 42-cell calendar, weekday alignment, today state, month navigation, and task context, plus Playwright coverage for mobile layout and persisted date drag-and-drop.
- Verification: `pnpm test` passes (67 tests), `pnpm build` passes, full serial Playwright passes (21 tests), and `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-10-23 — Keep calendar dates and tasks visible on mobile

- Removed the horizontally oversized mobile calendar that initially hid later weekdays, including the current day and its tasks.
- Fit all seven weekday columns into the mobile viewport while keeping task titles visible for up to two lines inside their date cells.
- Hid secondary project text and compacted counts, spacing, and typography only on small screens.
- Strengthened Playwright coverage to assert that the current date and its task card are physically inside the viewport width, with no horizontal calendar overflow, and that date drag-and-drop still works.
- Verification: `pnpm test` passes (67 tests), `pnpm build` passes, full serial Playwright passes (21 tests), and `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-10-25 — Fix comment submission in Android browsers

- Comment submission no longer assumes `crypto.randomUUID()` exists. It falls back to a timestamp plus random suffix, covering Android browsers opened over a non-secure local network connection.
- Updated both the Add comment button and Ctrl+Enter path, and exercised button submission with the UUID API unavailable.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (39 tests), frontend production build passes, and `git diff --check` passes. Full `pnpm test` remains blocked by the backend test server fixture: Supertest receives a null server address in all 16 backend tests.

## 2026-10-25 — Simplify empty task details on mobile

- On phone and tablet widths (up to 900px), hide empty Labels, Comments, and Date sections in Task details and show compact Add labels, Add comments, and Add date actions instead.
- Add labels reveals the label editor and focuses its input; Add comments reveals the comment editor and focuses its textarea; Add date opens the date dialog and focuses its date input. Existing values keep their sections visible.
- Added Playwright coverage to the mobile Task details scenario for hidden empty sections, shortcuts, and focus behavior.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (39 tests), frontend production build passes, and `git diff --check` passes. `pnpm test` remains blocked by the existing backend Supertest null server address issue. `pnpm test:e2e` could not start the configured webServer.

## 2026-10-25 — Add removable mobile task detail sections

- Styled the mobile Labels, Comments, and Date sections as separate cards with an X control in each section heading.
- Closing a section clears its corresponding task data, hides the section, and restores its Add action; the Add action is hidden while its section is open.
- Added frontend coverage that verifies labels, comments, and dates are cleared and their Add actions return.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (42 tests), frontend production build passes, and `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-10-25 — Restore desktop task details presentation

- Kept the optional-section cards and close controls scoped to tablet/mobile widths (900px and below).
- Restored the desktop Date remove button and prevented the new optional-section heading wrapper from inheriting the sidebar's generic flex layout.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (42 tests), frontend production build passes, and `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-10-25 — Add the mobile Subtasks collapse flow

- On phone and tablet widths, hide the empty Subtasks card and show Add subtasks. Opening it reveals the card and focuses the new subtask field; the Add button disappears while the card is open.
- Added an X control to the mobile Subtasks header. It deletes all direct child tasks (including their server-side descendants), closes the card, and restores Add subtasks.
- Added frontend tests for reveal/focus and deleting existing child tasks, and extended the mobile Playwright scenario.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (44 tests), frontend production build passes, and `git diff --check` passes. Playwright not rerun because its configured webServer did not start in the preceding session.

## 2026-10-25 — Ensure mobile Add subtasks opens its card

- Made the open/hidden state explicit on the Subtasks card, forced the open card to display at phone/tablet widths, and scroll it into view after tapping Add subtasks.
- Extended the unit and Playwright checks to assert that the card becomes visible after the tap.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (44 tests), frontend production build passes, and `git diff --check` passes. Playwright not run because its configured webServer could not start in this environment.

## 2026-10-25 — Prevent mobile Subtasks card height clipping

- The open Subtasks card now has a non-shrinking natural height in the mobile vertical flex layout, preventing its overflow clipping from truncating content.
- Extended the mobile Playwright scenario to create a subtask and verify the card body fits inside the card.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (44 tests), frontend production build passes, and `git diff --check` passes. Playwright not run because its configured webServer could not start in this environment.

## 2026-10-25 — Confirm deletion from mobile detail section controls

- Mobile close controls for Labels, Comments, and Subtasks now always ask before deleting data already saved on the task. Cancel keeps the section and its data intact.
- Empty sections or unsaved drafts close without a confirmation; saved data is cleared only after confirmation.
- Added coverage for declined confirmations across all three sections.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (45 tests), frontend production build passes, and `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-10-25 — Collapse optional fields in mobile Add task dialog

- Added mobile-only shortcuts for Description, Date, and Labels to the Add task dialog; all three fields stay collapsed until requested, and empty fields can be cleared/collapsed with an X control.
- Description and Labels focus their inputs when opened; Add date opens the date picker and focuses its date input. Desktop fields remain visible with their existing controls.
- Added frontend and Playwright coverage for the mobile open/focus flow.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (46 tests), frontend production build passes, and `git diff --check` passes. Playwright could not start its configured webServer.

## 2026-10-25 — Keep Add task shortcuts off desktop UI

- Scoped the Add task compact shortcuts and collapsed-field styles to touch devices with a coarse pointer, so a narrow desktop window no longer displays mobile Add description/date/labels buttons.
- Added E2E checks for desktop fields remaining visible and mobile touch shortcuts/focus behavior; unit tests continue to cover the interactions.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (46 tests), frontend production build passes, and `git diff --check` passes. E2E could not start because the configured Playwright webServer exited during startup.

## 2026-10-25 — Correct desktop visibility of Add task shortcuts

- Fixed CSS specificity: the generic Add task form rule for direct child divs had overridden the rule that hides the mobile shortcut row, leaving its buttons visible on desktop. The shortcut row now uses a selector strong enough to remain hidden on desktop and becomes visible only under the mobile touch media query.
- Desktop E2E coverage for this visibility is present; E2E execution remains blocked by Playwright webServer startup.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (46 tests), frontend production build passes, and `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-10-25 — Keep quick add visible on mobile

- Added a fixed, bottom-right mobile quick-add button with a plus icon; it opens the task form using the current project or section placement.
- Added mobile E2E assertions for button visibility and viewport placement.
- Verification: frontend tests pass (46 tests), frontend production build passes, and `git diff --check` passes. E2E could not start because the configured Playwright webServer exited during startup.
